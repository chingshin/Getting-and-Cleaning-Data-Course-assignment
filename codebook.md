## Variables

- subject

An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. It ranges from 1 to 30, no unit.
        
- activity

A description of the activity performed during the observation. Original values (ranging from 1 to 6) 
were replaced with descriptive terms according to the activity_labels.txt file in the original data set. 
featured activities: WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS SITTING STANDING LAYING

Means of time domain signals were captured at a constant bitrate of 50 Hz. Median and a 3rd order Low pass Butterworth 
filter were used to remove noise. Signals were split into body and gravity acceleration. The body linear acceleration 
and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals for the X,Y, and Z axis.  Also the magnitude of these 
three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. Axial acceleration is measured in standard gravity 
units 'g'. Mean, stad, and magnitude also have this unit.

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the timedomain signals to produce thse frequency domain signals. 
Axial acceleration is measured in standard gravity units 'g'. Mean, stad, and magnitude also have this unit.
