# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-assignment


The task of this assignment was to create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files and directories
   - UCI HAR Dataset  (directory): The original data files obtained from <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>.
   - README.md : This file
   - Codebook.md : A description of the variables in the tidy dataset and the transformations by which they were created.
   - run_analysis.R : A script to generate the files with the tidy datasets from the original data files.
   - UCI HAR tidy data.txt : A tidy dataset that combines the train and test datasets from the original data.
   - UCI HAR subject activity means.txt : A second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
